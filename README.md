# **DIY ESP32-CAM Smart Surveillance System**  

🚀 **A low-cost, battery-powered surveillance camera with motion detection, live streaming, and Telegram bot integration!**  

## 📌 **About the Project**  
This project is a DIY smart surveillance system built using the ESP32-CAM. For better coverage, it supports motion-triggered recording, remote access, and servo-controlled movement. The recordings are automatically stored and can be accessed via a Telegram bot.  

This repository is **forked from** [s60sc's ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD](https://github.com/s60sc/ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD) and modified to add extended features.  

## 🔧 **Features**  
✅ **Live Video Streaming** – Access real-time footage remotely  
✅ **Motion Detection & Auto-Recording** – Captures only significant events  
✅ **Wide-Angle Coverage** – Servo-controlled movement for better monitoring  
✅ **Telegram Bot Integration** – View recordings anytime, anywhere  
✅ **Battery-Powered Operation** – Provides **2-3 hours of backup**, 24/7 runtime when plugged in  
✅ **Sustainable Build** – Repurposed old **laptop batteries** for eco-friendly power  
✅ **Cost-Effective** – Built under **₹700 INR** (excluding retrieved components)  

## 🛠️ **Hardware Components**  
- **ESP32-CAM** – Handles video streaming & processing  
- **TP4056 Module** – LiPo battery charging  
- **Mini DC-DC Boost Step-Up Converter Board** – Voltage regulation
